## 3.4.0 (11.09.2026)
- Added synced lyrics — attach a `.lrc` (or `.txt`) file alongside a track and the active visualization draws the current line, with the previous and next lines above and below it. `Pulsar` and `Spectrogram` display them.
- Added online lyrics lookup — a track with no attached file gets synced lyrics searched by filename, cached per track and rechecked once a day.
- Added a **Lyrics** section to the configurator: a lyrics toggle, a lookup toggle, and a **Shake** slider (0–1) for how much of the visualization's own motion carries the text.
- Tracks now appear in the playlist as you add them, disabled until their duration is read, instead of the whole batch landing when the last file finishes. A file that fails to load is dropped from the list.
- Playlist rows now carry a mark when the track has lyrics.
- The configurator now nests its options — analysis options under **Type**, the AI's learning and feedback controls under **AI**.
- Added `environment.lyrics` (`LyricsView | null` with `previous`, `current`, `next`, `shake`) to the contributor API — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## 3.3.2 (04.08.2026)
- Added keyboard reordering — focus a track's drag handle and press <kbd>↑</kbd>/<kbd>↓</kbd> to move that track up or down the playlist.
- The playlist now updates rows in place instead of rebuilding the whole list, so keyboard focus survives track changes and rows no longer flicker on every update.
- The "No tracks yet" message now uses the correct muted styling, and an empty track list no longer leaves a gap above it.
- The playback-mode button now starts on the correct icon instead of briefly showing none.
- **Breaking:** <kbd>Tab</kbd> now opens the configurator and <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> opens the playlist, restoring the arrangement used before 3.3.0. Use <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> wherever you pressed <kbd>Tab</kbd> in 3.3.0.

## 3.3.0 (01.08.2026)
- Replaced single-track upload with a full playlist: add multiple tracks via the file picker or by dropping files onto the page, reorder them by dragging, and remove them individually.
- Added playback modes — repeat one, play through once (default), loop all, and shuffle — cycled from a button in the new playlist panel.
- Added previous/next track controls next to the play indicator, plus <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>←</kbd>/<kbd>→</kbd> shortcuts.
- Added <kbd>←</kbd>/<kbd>→</kbd> to seek 5 seconds back or forward.
- The current track title is now shown in the interface.
- A track saved in an earlier version is carried over into the playlist automatically on first launch.
- Audio data left behind by removed tracks is now cleaned up on startup.
- The panel you last had open — playlist or configurator — is reopened on the next session.
- Visualization settings now heal themselves when a visualization is added or removed, instead of failing to start.
- <kbd>Space</kbd> and the arrow keys are now ignored while you are typing in a field, and the arrows are ignored while a panel is open.
- Redesigned the icon set; the playlist and configurator panels now keep their header fixed while the contents scroll.
- Fixed the play/pause indicator and screen wake lock not resetting when a track finished playing.
- **Breaking:** <kbd>Tab</kbd> now opens the playlist and <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> opens the configurator. Use <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> where you previously pressed <kbd>Tab</kbd>.
- **Breaking:** Visualizations are now cycled with <kbd>↑</kbd>/<kbd>↓</kbd> instead of <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd>.

## 3.2.0 (15.07.2026)
- Added a screen wake lock — the display now stays awake while audio is playing or a clip is recording.
- The Spectrogram visualization has been redesigned with a mirrored frequency ridge, bass bloom, a temporal shimmer thread, and a vignette, plus beat-synced pulsing and DJ-focus-weighted detail.
- Visualizations now recolor live when the page theme (light/dark) changes instead of only on the next resize.
- The selected visualization is now saved and restored between sessions.
- Improved the playback seek bar: scrubbing now uses pointer capture and works reliably on touch devices.
- The Pulsar visualization now derives its inner halo tint from the background color and has a stronger bass-driven glow.

## 3.1.0 (12.07.2026)
- Auto-correction upgraded from a static scene classifier to a self-teaching DJ that continuously adjusts focus, spread, boost, tilt, and punch in real time via reinforcement learning.
- Added gain boost, spectral tilt, and compressor punch controls to the Configurator, giving direct access to the five parameters the DJ head learns to tune automatically.
- Visualization rendering moved to a dedicated Web Worker with an OffscreenCanvas, keeping the main thread free and improving frame consistency under load.
- Visualization authoring API updated: custom visualizations now extend `Visualization` and register via `Registry.attach()`; `rebuild()` and `update()` receive a `VisualizationHost` parameter instead of accessing properties via `this`.
- The built-in Pulsar and Spectrogram visualizations now respond to the richer audio analysis — beat-drop shake, bass-driven glow, and spectral hue shifts driven by the DJ's boost, tilt, spread, and punch.
- Core updated to Adaptive Extender 1.0.3.
- Project retargeted to ES2025.

## 3.0.0 (28.05.2026)
- Added clip recording — a button in the interface lets you record the visualization and download it as a video file.

- Audio analysis runs in a background thread, keeping the interface smooth even on complex visualizations.
- Program stability and rendering consistency significantly improved.
