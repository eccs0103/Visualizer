## Custom Visualizations

Custom visualizations are added in [`studio/view/visualizations.ts`](./studio/view/visualizations.ts).

Extend `Visualization` and pass the class to `Registry.attach()`. The call must appear before the visualizer starts.

```typescript
import "adaptive-extender/core";
import { type VisualizationHost } from "../models/visualization.js";
import { Registry, Visualization } from "../services/visualization-registry.js";

Registry.attach("My custom title", class extends Visualization {
	// Called when the canvas is resized or the active visualization changes.
	rebuild(host: VisualizationHost): void {
		const { context, audioset, environment } = host;
		const { width, height } = context.canvas;
	}

	// Called on every frame.
	update(host: VisualizationHost): void {
		const { audioset, environment, lyrics } = host;
		const { delta, isLaunched } = environment;
		if (lyrics !== null) {
			const { previous, current, next } = lyrics;
		}
	}
});
```

## Submitting NN Weights

The auto-correction system uses a neural network that learns in real time to adjust the analyser's focus, spread, boost, tilt, and punch for the audio it hears. If you have trained a set of weights that performs noticeably better, you can submit them to become the new default.

### Architecture

Four-layer actor-critic network with leaky-ReLU activations in the hidden layers:

```
320 inputs → 64 → 32 → control head: 5 outputs (tanh)
                      → value head:   1 output  (linear)
```

Inputs are normalised frequency-domain and time-domain bins. The control head outputs five bipolar deltas (tanh) mapped to the five DJ parameters; the value head estimates the expected long-term reward for online TD learning.

### Training in developer mode

1. Open the studio and append `?developer` to the URL, e.g.:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/studio/?developer
   ```
2. Load a song and press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to open the Configurator.
3. In the **AI** section, enable **Auto Learn** to let the model learn from the audio continuously via reinforcement learning. Use the **Good** / **Bad** feedback buttons to guide learning when the auto-correction is noticeably right or wrong.
4. Once satisfied with the reward shown in the panel, click **Export** — this downloads `nn-weights.json`.

### Submitting

In the **AI** section, click the **Share** button — it opens a pre-filled GitHub issue form. Attach the downloaded `nn-weights.json` and include a brief description of what audio you trained on and the reward level you observed.
